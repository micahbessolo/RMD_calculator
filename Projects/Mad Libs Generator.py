{noun}, and make a thin, round {adjective_2} {noun_2}. Then you cover it with {adjective_3} sauce, {adjective_4} cheese,
and freshly chopped {plural_noun}. Next you have to bake it in a very hot {noun_4}. When it is done, cut it into
{number} {shape}. Some kids like {food} pizza the best, but my favorite is the {food_2} pizza. If I could, I would eat
